The plumes of steam from the geysers was massive.\n- got breakfast at Old Faithful Inn. Walked through the geyser basin at the hotel. Saw Old Faithful blow for a third time.\n- went back to the geysers from this morning with Fenn. Grand Prismatic was _packed_. Fenn told some guy that it was illegal to be off the boardwalk (there were signs _everywhere_). I was proud of my little Mother Earth cop.\n- Went to West Thumb geysers. _So_ pretty and way less crowded\n- Drove into Grand Tetons. Gorgeous drive. Got to our campground and was told that there was a bear in the camp 10 days ago and he's been seen pacing outside the campsite. also there were 3 wolves on the other side of camp. also our site was literally too small for a tent. We looked up local hotels, saw it would cost $700 for 2 nights (lol, Jackson Hole), and decided to get a can of bear spray instead"

The woman he was with was a few paces behind and when we crossed paths she warned us there was a bear up ahead, I guess the man would have just let us get eaten.\n- got lunch/dinner in Jackson Hole\n- Did scenic float on Snake River at sunset. It was incredibly fun + beautiful. Fenn saw the first moose! Our guide said Fenn had a \"good eye!\" (Fenn asked that I include this detail). It was a magical way to end our Teton Day"

Fenn found it easier than I did, my lungs don't like this environment\n-- Landscape Arch in Devil's Garden - so fun to walk through all the slabs\n-- Sand Arch & Broken Arch - a little crowded but still fun\n-- Park Avenue - started to heat up by this time but this hike was stunning\n- After Arches, ate a big meal at Moab brewing, chilled that night\n- Wen to Lin Ottinger's Rock Shop - most magical store in the world!"

The canyons turned an incredible purple color.\n- Then we got some late night Mexican food back in Moab. People were setting off fireworks all over town for the 4th"

After camping + random airbnbs, it felt so luxurious\n- notable weird encounter: the aggro man in the elevator who somehow grabbed his wife's ass at us?\n- Drove to Park City to eat at 'Handle', Fenn's friend Sam (aka Taters) from high school is the head chef there. The food + service was _amazing_. We had personalized menus with our names on them. Sam brought out _5_ free apps for us (sour cream + onion dip with caviar, scallops in a lime curry sauce, soft shell crab, duck confit, and bok choy with pork belly)!

The place was built in 1910 and they have a crazy cocktail menu + floor to ceiling shelves of booze with a Beauty and the Beast style ladder\n- Went to Temple Square. The Mormon Temple was covered in scaffolding but we got to see the admin building, Relief Society, and the controversial City Creek Mall that houses Desert Books, among other things\n- rode in the elevator with 2 players from the NBA team the Memphis Grizzlies! they were very polite!"
